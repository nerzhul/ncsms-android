Nextcloud SMS synchronizes your text messages (SMS) to a remote Nextcloud instance, letting you read your messages from Nextcloud.
	    
It also makes it possible to restore messages from Nextcloud.

Note: to function, Nextcloud SMS requires the Phone Sync (aka ocsms) app to be installed on Nextcloud.
	    
Sending text messages from a Nextcloud instance will come in a future release.

This application is fully compatible with Android 4.0 to 8.0
